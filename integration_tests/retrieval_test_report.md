## Test Results Summary

### 1. Retrieval Accuracy Testing

| Query Category | Pass Rate | Avg Relevance Score | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Simple Factual | 75% | 0.75 | Failed on "What day are hearings?" |
| Form-Related | 100% | 1.00 | Perfect performance |
| Procedural | 50% | 0.83 | Missing "steps" context in some queries |
| Complex | 50% | 0.83 | Issues with specific legal citations |

#### Notable Failures:
- **"What day are hearings?"** - Did not retrieve chunks containing "Thursday"
- **ICWA queries** - Missing specific legal citations like "MCL 712B"
- **Tribal notification** - Not extracting "notify tribe" requirement clearly

### 2. Query Type Testing

The system handles different query formats effectively:

| Format | Success | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Question | ✓ | "What is the filing fee?" |
| Keywords | ✓ | "filing fee guardianship" |
| Statement | ✓ | "I need to know the filing fee" |
| Command | ✓ | "tell me the filing fee" |
| Incomplete | ✓ | "filing fee" |
| Conversational | ✓ | "hey can you help me figure out..." |

### 3. Performance Metrics

Excellent latency performance across all complexity levels:

| Complexity | Avg Latency | Budget | Compliance |
|------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Simple | 89ms | 300ms | 100% |
| Standard | 287ms | 500ms | 100% |
| Complex | 338ms | 800ms | 100% |

**Overall Performance:**
- Average latency: 201ms
- Budget compliance: 100%
- No timeout issues observed

### 4. Retrieval Parameters

#### Top-K Testing
The system encountered errors when attempting to modify top_k values, indicating this parameter may not be directly configurable on the HybridRetriever object.

#### Search Mode Comparison
- **Vector-only search**: Error encountered (BM25 dependency)
- **Hybrid search**: Working correctly, combining vector and BM25 scores

#### Complexity Classification Impact
Working correctly:
- Simple queries: top_k=5, no rewrites
- Standard queries: top_k=10, 3 rewrites
- Complex queries: top_k=15, 5 rewrites

### 5. Edge Case Handling

| Edge Case | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Out-of-scope detection | 66% (2/3) | Failed on "adult guardianship" query |
| Ambiguous queries | ✓ | Handles single-word queries appropriately |
| Very long queries | ✓ | Maintains relevance despite length |
| Queries with typos | ✓ | 100% success rate with typos |

## Technical Observations

### Strengths
1. **Hybrid Search**: Effectively combines vector and BM25 scoring
2. **Reranking**: Cross-encoder reranking improves result quality
3. **Complexity Classification**: Accurately classifies query complexity
4. **Latency Management**: Excellent performance across all query types

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Keyword Matching**: Some exact keywords not being found (e.g., "Thursday")
2. **Legal Citations**: Specific statute numbers not always retrieved
3. **Context Extraction**: Some contextual requirements not fully captured
4. **Parameter Access**: top_k parameter not directly modifiable

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Keyword Extraction**
   - Consider adding keyword boosting for important terms
   - Implement exact match fallback for critical information

2. **Enhance Legal Citation Handling**
   - Add special handling for statute numbers (MCL, MCR references)
   - Consider creating a citation index

3. **Optimize Chunk Boundaries**
   - Review chunking strategy to ensure key facts aren't split
   - Consider overlap to capture context better

4. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add more edge cases for multi-lingual queries
   - Test with intentionally adversarial queries
   - Add stress testing with concurrent queries

5. **Improve Complex Query Handling**
   - Fine-tune reranking for ICWA-related queries
   - Add domain-specific query expansion for legal terms

## Conclusion

The retrieval system demonstrates solid performance with a 70% pass rate on golden Q&A tests and excellent latency compliance. The main areas for improvement are:

1. Better exact keyword matching for specific facts
2. Enhanced legal citation retrieval
3. Improved context extraction for complex requirements

The system successfully handles various query formats, maintains low latency, and effectively manages different complexity levels. With the recommended improvements, the system could achieve >90% accuracy on the golden test set.
