Hybrid Architecture: Cloud Embeddings + Local LLM with Privacy Protection

Yes, this is absolutely possible and actually a very smart approach! You can offload the computationally expensive embedding/search to the cloud while keeping user queries private and the LLM completely local.

Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Architecture

Core Concept: Query Abstraction Layer

The key is to never send raw user queries to the cloud. Instead, you send only document embeddings and receive back document chunks, then process everything locally.

How It Works





Pre-Processing (One-Time Setup)





Upload your knowledge base documents to cloud vector service



Generate embeddings for all KB documents in the cloud



Store document chunks with embeddings in cloud vector DB



Runtime Query Processing





User asks: "How do I file for guardianship in Genesee County?"



Local embedding: Generate query embedding locally (small model)



Cloud search: Send only the embedding vector (numbers) to cloud



Cloud returns: Relevant document chunks (your KB content)



Local LLM: Process query + retrieved chunks entirely locally

Privacy Protection Mechanisms

What Goes to Cloud:





‚úÖ Your knowledge base documents (legal documents you own)



‚úÖ Embedding vectors (just numbers, no semantic meaning)



‚úÖ Document chunk IDs and metadata

What NEVER Goes to Cloud:





‚ùå User queries (processed entirely locally)



‚ùå User conversations or personal information



‚ùå Generated responses



‚ùå Any user-identifiable data

Implementation Options

Option 1: Pinecone + Local Processing (Recommended)

Architecture:
- Cloud Vector DB: Pinecone (free tier: 100K vectors)
- Local Query Embedding: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (22MB)
- Local LLM: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (quantized, 2GB)
- Privacy: Query embeddings generated locally

Cost: $0-10/month (mostly free tier)

Privacy Flow:





User query ‚Üí Local embedding model ‚Üí Vector [0.1, -0.3, 0.7, ...]



Send vector to Pinecone ‚Üí Receive document chunks



Local LLM processes: query + chunks ‚Üí Response



User never exposed to cloud

Option 2: Azure Cognitive Search + Local Processing

Architecture:
- Cloud Vector DB: Azure Cognitive Search (free tier available)
- Local Query Embedding: sentence-transformers model
- Local LLM: Quantized model via llama.cpp
- Privacy: Same query abstraction approach

Cost: $0-15/month (free tier + minimal usage)

Option 3: Self-Hosted Vector Service

Architecture:
- Cloud Vector DB: Qdrant on cheap VPS ($5/month)
- Local Query Embedding: Local model
- Local LLM: Local quantized model
- Privacy: Full control over vector service

Cost: $5-10/month for VPS

Technical Implementation

Modified Pipeline Architecture

// Conceptual flow (in your Python code)
class HybridPrivateRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.local_embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.cloud_vector_db = PineconeClient()
        self.local_llm = LocalLlamaModel()
    
    def get_answer(self, user_query: str):
        # 1. Generate embedding locally (private)
        query_embedding = self.local_embedder.encode(user_query)
        
        # 2. Search cloud with just the vector (no query text)
        doc_chunks = self.cloud_vector_db.search(
            vector=query_embedding,
            top_k=5
        )
        
        # 3. Process everything locally (private)
        response = self.local_llm.generate(
            prompt=f"Query: {user_query}\nContext: {doc_chunks}"
        )
        
        return response

Privacy-Enhanced Setup

Knowledge Base Upload (One-Time)

# Upload your KB to cloud (your documents, not user data)
def upload_knowledge_base():
    documents = load_michigan_guardianship_docs()
    
    for doc in documents:
        # Generate embedding in cloud
        embedding = cloud_embedder.embed(doc.content)
        
        # Store in cloud vector DB
        cloud_vector_db.upsert(
            id=doc.id,
            vector=embedding,
            metadata={
                "content": doc.content,
                "source": doc.source,
                "doc_type": doc.type
            }
        )

Query Processing (Runtime)

# User query processing (privacy-preserving)
def process_user_query(query: str):
    # Local embedding (no cloud exposure)
    query_vector = local_embedder.encode(query)
    
    # Cloud search (only vector, no query text)
    results = cloud_vector_db.query(
        vector=query_vector.tolist(),
        top_k=5,
        include_metadata=True
    )
    
    # Extract document chunks
    context_chunks = [r.metadata['content'] for r in results.matches]
    
    # Local LLM processing (completely private)
    response = local_llm.generate(
        system_prompt=LEGAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        user_query=query,
        context=context_chunks
    )
    
    return response

Recommended Approach

Go with Option 1: Pinecone + Local LLM

Why This is Optimal:





Privacy: User queries never leave your server



Cost: Mostly free tier usage



Performance: Fast vector search + local LLM



Compliance: Easy to meet legal requirements



Scalability: Handles growth without infrastructure management

Next Steps:





Test Phase: Set up Pinecone free account and upload your KB



Validate: Compare retrieval quality with current ChromaDB



Implement: Add local LLM integration



Deploy: Gradual rollout with monitoring

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: cloud-scale vector search performance with complete user privacy and local control over the LLM reasoning process.


<then Traycer proposed a 6-phase plan in order to implement option 1. The text below is the 6 phase plan it proposed>

[1. Set up Pinecone account and migrate the Michigan guardianship knowledge base from ChromaDB to Pinecone. Create new script `scripts/migrate_to_pinecone.py` that loads documents from `kb_files/`, generates embeddings using a cloud service, and uploads to Pinecone with proper metadata. Test vector search quality compared to current ChromaDB retrieval. Ensure all document chunks, metadata, and form references are properly indexed.


Relevant Files:

- @embed_kb.py

- @embed_kb_cloud.py

- @kb_files

- @embedding.yaml



2. Implement lightweight local query embedding using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. Create `scripts/local_embedder.py` class that handles query embedding locally without sending queries to cloud. Modify `scripts/adaptive_retrieval.py` to use local embedder + Pinecone search instead of ChromaDB. Ensure the `AdaptiveHybridRetriever` class maintains same interface but uses Pinecone backend. Test retrieval quality and latency.


Relevant Files:

- @adaptive_retrieval.py

- @retrieval_setup.py

- @retrieval_pipeline.yaml




3. Integrate quantized local LLM (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) using llama.cpp or similar runtime. Extend `scripts/llm_handler.py` to support local model path alongside existing cloud APIs. Add `LOCAL_MODE` environment variable to route LLM calls to local model. Ensure structured response generation works with local LLM and maintains citation enforcement. Test response quality against current Gemini outputs.


Relevant Files:

- @llm_handler.py

- @production_pipeline.py

- @schemas.py




4. Update `scripts/production_pipeline.py` to use the new hybrid architecture. Modify `GuardianshipRAG` class to use Pinecone retriever and local LLM when `LOCAL_MODE=true`. Ensure conversation state, response validation, and disclaimer policies work unchanged. Update `app.py` initialization to support local-only mode. Test end-to-end pipeline with sample legal queries.


Relevant Files:

- @production_pipeline.py

- @app.py

- @conversation_state.py

- @disclaimer_policy.py





5. Implement caching strategies for the hybrid system. Add query embedding cache, Pinecone result cache, and local LLM response cache. Optimize Pinecone search parameters for best recall/latency tradeoff. Add monitoring for local vs cloud latencies. Create configuration options in `config/` files for cache sizes, timeouts, and fallback behaviors. Test system under load.


Relevant Files:

- @retrieval_pipeline.yaml

- @model_configs_phase3.yaml

- @logger.py




Run comprehensive testing using existing test suites in `integration_tests/`. Compare hybrid system performance against current system using `integration_tests/run_golden_qa.py`. Validate that citation accuracy, legal compliance, and response quality are maintained. Test privacy guarantees by monitoring network traffic. Create performance benchmarks and quality metrics dashboard.
