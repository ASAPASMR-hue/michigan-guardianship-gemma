Overview of Minor Guardianships in Michigan
In Michigan, the Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC) governs the legal process for appointing a guardian for a minor. This overview explains what a minor guardianship is, the different types, and when one might be necessary. The primary laws for minor guardianship can be found in Article V of EPIC (MCL 700.5201–.5219).
What is a minor guardianship?
A minor guardianship is a legal relationship created when a probate court gives an adult (the guardian) the authority and responsibility to care for a minor (the ward) because the child's parents are unable to do so.
* Powers and Duties: A guardian has the same powers as a parent to make decisions about the child's care, housing, education, and medical needs. However, a guardian is not legally obligated to use their own personal funds to support the child.
* Parental Rights: Crucially, a guardianship does not terminate a parent's legal rights. This makes it fundamentally different from an adoption, which permanently ends the legal parent-child relationship.
Guardian vs. Conservator: What’s the Difference?
While the terms are often confused, their roles are distinct:
* A Guardian is responsible for the child's personal well-being (care, custody, education).
* A Conservator is responsible for managing the child's financial assets and property (the "estate").
The probate court can appoint a guardian, a conservator, or both. A conservatorship is typically needed when a minor owns money or property requiring management. However, if a minor is entitled to receive $5,000 or less per year, the court may decide a conservator is not necessary.
Types of Minor Guardianships
Michigan law outlines three main types of guardianships. The court will only appoint a guardian if it serves the child's welfare.


Here's the information from the table in a text-topic format:


Types of Minor Guardianships
* Full Guardianship
   * Key Features & When It Applies: The court can appoint a full guardian if the parental rights of both parents (or the sole parent) have been suspended or terminated. This can happen due to a court order, death, disappearance, or if the parents have let the minor live with someone else without providing legal authority for their care (MCL 700.5204(2)).
* Limited Guardianship
   * Key Features & When It Applies: This is a voluntary arrangement. It requires the parents with custody to consent to suspending their parental rights and agree to a Limited Guardianship Placement Plan with the proposed guardian. This plan, approved by the court, must outline parenting time, financial support, and the reasons for the guardianship (MCL 700.5205).
* Temporary Guardianship
   * Key Features & When It Applies: The court can appoint a temporary guardian for up to six months in an emergency or while a formal guardianship petition is pending. This ensures the child's immediate needs are met (MCL 700.5213(3)).

Key Responsibilities of a Guardian
A guardian has significant legal duties and is accountable to the court. Core responsibilities include:
* Acting in the child's best interests.
* Providing for the child's care, comfort, and education.
* Filing an Annual Report with the court on the child's condition (MCR 5.404(G)).
* Managing the child's personal effects and, if necessary, their assets by filing an inventory with the court.
* Facilitating court-ordered parenting time between the child and their parents.
Is a Guardianship Necessary? The Power of Attorney Alternative
For temporary situations, a Delegation of Parental Authority (Power of Attorney) may be a simpler alternative. This document allows a parent to give another adult decision-making authority for their child without court oversight. However, under Michigan law (MCL 700.5103), this authority is limited to a maximum of six months. For longer-term needs, a guardianship is required.
What is the Process to Establish a Guardianship?
The process generally follows these steps, which are explained in more detail in other documents:
1. File a Petition: An interested person files a petition with the probate court in the county where the minor lives.
2. Court Hearing: The court holds a hearing to determine if a guardianship is in the child's best interests.
3. Appointment: If approved, the court issues Letters of Guardianship, which grant the guardian legal authority.
4. Oversight: The court monitors the guardianship through annual reports and reviews.

The Role of a Guardian ad Litem (GAL)
A Guardian ad Litem, often referred to as a "GAL," serves a crucial function in minor guardianship proceedings, acting as an impartial representative for the minor's best interests or directly advocating for the minor's wishes.
Here’s an in-depth look at their role:
•
Appointment of a GAL
◦
The court must appoint a guardian ad litem when required by law. Beyond legal mandates, the court may appoint a GAL if it determines that the minor’s interests are, or may be, inadequately represented. This also applies in proceedings for a conservator's appointment due to minority, where an attorney appointed to represent the minor will have the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.
◦
The court may also appoint a GAL to assist it in determining a child’s best interests.
◦
In specific scenarios, such as when a petition for limited guardianship is filed for a child whose parent is an unemancipated minor, the court shall appoint a GAL to represent the minor parent.
◦
It's worth noting that the person initiating the guardianship or protective proceeding cannot recommend a specific individual to be appointed as a guardian ad litem. The court must state the purpose of the appointment in the order, which can be issued with or without prior notice.
•
Duties and Responsibilities
◦
A primary duty of a GAL is to conduct an investigation and either report in open court or file a written report with recommendations before the hearing. They are generally not required to appear personally at the hearing unless specifically directed by the court or required by law.
◦
For adult incapacity cases, the GAL's duties are quite detailed, including: personally visiting the individual; explaining the nature, purpose, and legal effects of the guardianship; explaining the hearing procedure and the individual's rights; informing the individual of the names of those seeking appointment; and making determinations about appropriate alternatives to a full guardianship (like a limited guardianship, conservatorship, patient advocate designation, or durable power of attorney).
◦
For minor guardianships, the GAL for the minor parent helps ensure their consent makes the limited guardianship plan binding.
◦
In conservatorship cases, the GAL also considers and reports on whether alternatives to conservatorship exist and if the scope of the conservator's authority should be limited.
•
Evidence and Confidentiality
◦
The GAL's oral and written reports may be received and relied upon by the court for their probative value, even if they wouldn't typically be admissible under the Michigan Rules of Evidence. Interested parties have the right to examine and challenge these reports, and in the court's discretion, may cross-examine the person who made the report if they are reasonably available.
◦
It's crucial to understand that when an attorney is appointed as a guardian ad litem, it does not create an attorney-client relationship, and communications between them are not subject to attorney-client privilege. The GAL is required to inform the person they represent about this lack of privilege. However, if that individual is later appointed as an attorney for the person, the attorney-client privilege will then apply retroactively to the date of the GAL appointment.
•
Compensation
◦
GALs are entitled to reasonable compensation from the protected individual's estate for their services, unless they are compensated otherwise. The court must approve their fees, and compensation is not ordered until the GAL confirms compliance with their duties.


 
The Role of Court Investigators (including DHHS/FIA)
Court investigators, often personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (formerly the Family Independence Agency or FIA) or court employees/agents, play a vital role in providing the court with essential information to make informed decisions regarding guardianships.
Here’s what the resources say about their contributions:
•
Initiation and Scope of Investigations
◦
The court may order an investigation of a proposed or existing guardianship by DHHS, a court employee, or another appointed agent. In fact, the court has a general obligation to review cases and arrange visits with many wards.
◦
Some counties, like St. Clair County, may have a DHHS court liaison specifically appointed for initial investigations on all new guardianships, and for petitions to terminate or modify them. These investigations, when performed by DHHS, may involve protective services staff or foster care staff.
◦
If a petition for guardianship indicates it is unknown whether the minor is an Indian child, the investigation must include an inquiry into Indian tribal membership.
•
Investigation Procedures and Reporting
◦
Investigators will review the court file, ask questions of the guardian (and co-guardian), and visit the ward at their residence.
◦
A written report of the investigation must be filed with the court. This report is typically due within 28 days after the investigator’s appointment.
◦
The report must include a recommendation regarding whether the guardianship should be continued or modified, specifying the nature of any recommended modification.
◦
For cases involving Indian children, the report must also include specific information required by the Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act. The report is filed with the court and served on interested persons.
•
Impact on Court Decisions and Services
◦
Following an informal review of the investigator's report, the court must either issue an order continuing the guardianship or schedule a hearing to be held within 14 days. If a hearing is set, the court has the option to appoint an attorney for the minor.
◦
Court investigators are also involved in providing testimony concerning their investigation and the best interests of the minor during termination proceedings.
◦
Furthermore, if a guardianship is terminated and a minor is to be reintegrated into their parent's home, the court may order DHHS (Family Independence Agency) to supervise this transition period (up to six months) and provide necessary services to facilitate the reintegration.
