This document provides a practical, "nuts-and-bolts" workflow for self-represented individuals filing a minor guardianship case in Genesee County Probate Court. It explains the specific court forms, deadlines, and procedures required to open your case and get your first hearing. 
●​ For an overview of what guardianship is and if it's the right option for you, see Document 	7: Legal Standards for Appointing a Guardian.
●​ For information on your duties after you are appointed, see Document 9: 	Post-Appointment Duties and Responsibilities.

All the forms discussed within this document are listed with each of their respective [URL] at the bottom of the document. Make sure to include links to those documents in your responses when appropriate. 

§ 8.1 Venue and Filing Fees 
Your first step is to file the right paperwork in the right court and pay the required fee. 	●​ ✔ Determine the Correct Court (Venue). File your petition in the Probate Court for the 		county where the minor resides or is physically present when you file (MCL 700.5211). 
	For this guide, you will file at: 
		○​ Genesee County Probate Court
		○​ Address: 900 S. Saginaw St., Room 502, Flint, MI 48502 
		○​ Phone: (810) 257-3528 
●​ ✔ Pay the Filing Fee. The fee to file a Petition to Appoint a Guardian of a Minor in 	Genesee County is $175.00. 
●​ ✔ Request a Fee Waiver if Needed. If you cannot afford the filing fee, you can ask the 	court to waive it. 
○​ Fill out and file a Fee Waiver Request (Form MC 20) along with your petition. 
○​ You may qualify if your household income is below 125% of the federal poverty guidelines or if paying the fee would otherwise be a financial hardship. You will need to provide proof of your income or public assistance (like FAP, Medicaid, or SSI). 
●​ Court scheduling note: The clerk sets hearings only on Thursdays. Missing your court 	date will cause the petition to be dismissed. 
●​ The court does not accept personal checks; pay with cash, money order, or 	credit/debit.

It may order the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or a court employee to conduct a home investigation and file a report before the hearing (MCR 5.404(A)(2)). Your completed Social History (PC 670) and background check authorizations are essential for this step.

§ 8.4 Service of Process: Notifying Interested Persons 

After you get a hearing date, you are legally required to notify all "interested persons" about the case. This is called service of process. Failing to do this correctly will cause your hearing to be delayed or your case to be dismissed.

●​ The Minor: Required if the minor is 14 years of age or older. 
●​ The Minor's Parents: Both legal parents must be served.

●​ ✔ Prove You Served Everyone. You must tell the court how and when you served each 	person. 
○​ Fill out and sign the Proof of Service (Form PC 564).
○​ File the completed PC 564 with the court before your hearing date. Genesee 	County requires this at least 5 days prior to the hearing. 
§ 8.5 Special Circumstances 
●​ ✔ If the Minor is an Indian Child: If the minor is or may be an "Indian Child," special 

federal and state laws apply. You must notify the child's tribe of the proceeding using the procedures in the Michigan Court Rules (MCR 5.109) and file proof of that notice with the court.

1.​ File a Declaration of Intent to Give Notice by Publication (Form PC 617) 	explaining your search efforts. 
2.​ Take the Publication of Notice of Hearing (Form PC 563) to the Flint-Genesee County Legal News counter (100 E. First St., Flint, MI). They will publish the notice and provide you with a sworn affidavit. 
3.​ File the publisher's affidavit and your completed Proof of Service (PC 564) with the 	court. The publication fee in Genesee County is approximately $96.05. 
●​ ✔ If There is an Emergency: If a child's welfare requires the immediate appointment of a 	guardian, you can ask the court to appoint a temporary guardian. 
○​ You must explain the specific emergency in detail in your petition. 
○​ The court can shorten the notice period or even appoint a temporary guardian without a hearing (ex parte) if there is good cause. If this happens, the court must hold a full hearing on the matter within 14 days (MCR 5.403(B)-(C)). 
§ 8.6 The First Court Hearing: What to Expect 
●​ ✔ Arrive Early. Give yourself plenty of time to find the courtroom. 
●​ ✔ Bring Photo ID.
●​ ✔ Bring Originals. Bring your original copies of the minor's birth certificate and any other 	important documents. 
●​ ✔ Be Prepared to Testify. The judge will place you under oath and ask you questions 	about why the guardianship is necessary and in the child's best interest. 
●​ ✔ Cooperate with the Guardian ad Litem (GAL). The court may appoint a GAL, who is an attorney or professional, to investigate and represent the child's best interests. Be prepared to speak with them before the hearing. 
●​ ✔ Receive the Judge's Decision. If the judge approves the petition, the final step is to 	make it official. 
○​ Sign and file an Acceptance of Appointment (Form PC 571). This is your official 	agreement to take on the role. 
○​ The court will then issue Letters of Guardianship (Form PC 633). This is your proof of legal authority. You will need certified copies of this document, which cost $11.00 each in Genesee County.
